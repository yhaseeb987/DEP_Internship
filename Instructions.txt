 Overview of the Red-Blue Nim Game
1. Red-Blue Nim Game Overview:
   - Two game versions:
     - Standard: Players lose if either pile is empty on their turn.
     - Misère: Players win if either pile is empty on their turn.
   - Objective: Implement the game in Python to understand game algorithms and AI decision-making.

 Game Rules
2. Game Rules:
   - Standard Version: Players lose if either pile is empty.
   - Misère Version: Players win if either pile is empty.
   - Scoring:
     - Red marble: 2 points.
     - Blue marble: 3 points.

 Command Line Usage
3. Command Line:
   - Usage: Describe how to start the game from the command line.
   - Parameters:
     - `<num-red>`: Number of red marbles.
     - `<num-blue>`: Number of blue marbles.
     - `<version>`: 'standard' or 'misere'.
     - `<first-player>`: 'computer' or 'human'.
     - `<depth>`: AI search depth (optional).

 Game Flow
4. Game Flow:
   - Turn Order: Alternates between human and computer.
   - Human Move: Prompt for human move and validate input.
   - Computer Move: Use MinMax algorithm with Alpha Beta Pruning for AI move.

 MinMax Algorithm
5. MinMax Algorithm:
   - Overview: Optimizes decision-making in the game.
   - Alpha Beta Pruning: Improves efficiency of MinMax.
   - Move Ordering:
     - Standard Version: 
       - Pick 2 red marbles.
       - Pick 2 blue marbles.
       - Pick 1 red marble.
       - Pick 1 blue marble.
     - Misère Version: 
       - Pick 1 blue marble.
       - Pick 1 red marble.
       - Pick 2 blue marbles.
       - Pick 2 red marbles.

 Depth-Limited Search (Extra Credit)
6. Depth-Limited Search:
   - Purpose: Faster decision-making.
   - Evaluation Function: Heuristic to evaluate non-terminal game states.
   - Extra Credit Details: Describe evaluation function reasoning.

 End of Game
7. End of Game:
   - Game Over Conditions: Game ends when either pile is empty.
   - Scoring Calculation: Based on remaining marbles.

 Implementation Details
8. Implementation Details:
   - Modules:
     - Command-line parsing
     - Game mechanics
     - Human and computer moves
     - AI decision-making with MinMax and Alpha Beta Pruning

 Demonstration
9. Demonstration:
